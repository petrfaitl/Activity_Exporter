{"name":"Activity Exporter","tagline":"Utility to convert sportswatch workout files to gpx format","body":"### About this project\r\nThis project had started as a response a Christmas 2014 outage of the [Movescount](http://www.movescount.com/) website. This is a Suunto owned and operated site that is used to support Suunto watches and devices.\r\n\r\n> #### YOUR SPORTS DIARY\r\nStore every single workout you do with the amount of detail you want. Whether you are a competing athlete, an outdoor maniac, a technical diver or just getting started with your new active life - Movescount is for you!\r\n\r\nAs you require an active connection to this website to export your workout logs from your watch, it became necessary to design a tool to analyse and convert Suunto workout files to a standard recognised format, such as .gpx. These can be used at other online analytics services, for example [Strava](http://www.strava.com/).\r\n\r\n### Contribute to this project\r\nFork this project\r\nFor help with forking a GitHub project, [https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/](check this guide).\r\n\r\n### Clone\r\nIf you prefer to take this project and take it some other places, feel free to clone it from  \r\n`https://github.com/petrfaitl/Activity_Exporter.git`.\r\n\r\n### Feature requests\r\nIf you would like some features incorporated?\r\n* If you know how to code in java, please fork and submit a pull request.\r\n* If coding is alien to you, fill in a [feedback form at the Issues page] (https://github.com/petrfaitl/Activity_Exporter/issues) and I'll have a look what I can do.\r\n\r\n### Bugs and other issues?\r\nIf you find any problems with the utility, you can post them at the simple [issue tracker](https://github.com/petrfaitl/Activity_Exporter/issues).\r\n\r\n### Authors and contributors\r\nThis project was initiated by Petr Faitl @petrfaitl in 2014.\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-40550671-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
